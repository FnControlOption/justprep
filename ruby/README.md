# `justprep`

Just a CLI pre-processor tool for task runners like "just" my current favorite.

This directory is the codebase for the Ruby gem implementation.  It also contains the common directory where \*.crb files are kept.  These are the files that are shared between this Ruby gem implementation and the Crystal implementation.

### Installation for the Ruby version

    gem install justprep

### Installation for the Crystal version

    brew install --build-from-source MadBomber/tap/justprep

### Documentation

Since this capability is implemented in both Ruby and Crystal there is only one set of documentation.  Both implementations act the same way.  See the [repository's Wiki](https://github.com/MadBomber/justprep/wiki) for details.


### Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/[USERNAME]/justprep.

If you have a different CLI task runner than what justprep currently supports, let me know so we can add it to the support list.
